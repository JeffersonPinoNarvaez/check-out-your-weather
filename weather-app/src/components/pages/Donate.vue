      <h1 class="tittle">Why should I even care about this section?</h1>
      <p>This piece of software is completely and free to use, modify or reproduce, as far as the terms and conditions go. But why should you take the time to donate if it is 100% free code? </p>
      <p>Well, if you donate, you are contributing so others can have more time to write more free, educational, and amazing code for sharing. </p>
      <h3>Donations contribute to make the authors of free code less private depending.</h3>
      <p>Everyone must put food on their tables, sometimes it’s easier sometimes it doesn’t, so by donating you are helping other programmers like you to easy things on their side. I’m 100% sure they will appreciate that to you!</p>
      <h3>Have you ever wondered why there is so much free code outside?</h3>
      <p>Well, that is because developers love free code and the communities that go with it. Writing free code world must be the mantra of every programmer out there. Schools should teach it even at a young age. University should have
        a free-code course on their schedule. That would be a wonderful world, wouldn’t it be? Well, the reality is quite different. Nowadays not too many people put attention on the authors that have put tons of efforts writing free code,
        free apps o great snippets of code! Those people that spend long nights and are trying to free the world. Let help them free themselves with a small donation!</p>
      <h3>How can I donate?</h3>
